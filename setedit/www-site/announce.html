<HTML><Title>announce for setedit</Title><Body><Pre>That's the announcement that I released the SET's editor v0.5.0:

What's SET's editor?

  SETEdit or setedit or SET's editor is a text mode oriented text editor
with the look & feel of the old Borland's IDE. It have windows that can be
overlapped, common widgets (buttons, menues, check and radio buttons,
etc.), mouse support and old the funny things you usually find in a GUI
editor (even when all is in text mode).
  The editor is mainly oriented for programmers because it have tons of
tools that helps writing programs, specially C/C++, but suitable to edit
any kind of text file. In fact the code page and fonts handling options
make it very suitable to edit text in different encodings and convert it
back and forth from one encoding to another. Some nice widgets like
graphical screen savers and MP3 player also makes the editor a funny
environment.
  For those who know about RHIDE: setedit is the same editor you can find
inside RHIDE but without the IDE itself, as it's the last version have more
features (and bugs?, I hope it have less ;-), seriously, I killed a huge
number of bugs most small but some very annoying).
  Is also true that some features takes a lot of time to be incorporated to
RHIDE or just won't be incorporated to RHIDE at all. The standalone editor
is also very suitable to be used for the parts of your project that are
handled with makefiles.

Main features:
* Easy to use for DOS users because have a lot of CUA and Wordstar commands
used in the editors of other compilers.
* Full configurable keyboard.
* Full configurable menu (OS dependent features and macros in menues).
* Advanced features: Rectangular blocks, intelligent indent, configurable
syntax highlight and more.
* Simple macro language, will be expanded only if the people is interested
and helps a bit (which is starting to happend).
* PMacros for fast writing.
* Real macros.
* Documentation tool for libraries or large projects.
* Fonts, code pages, screen modes and palette customization.
* You can run make or grep from the editor collecting the errors/hints.
* Clock and screen saver.
* Linux and Win32 versions.

Why I could want to download it if RHIDE exists?

  The editor is the newest version v0.5.0 and have a lot of differences with
the one included in RHIDE 1.4 (v0.3.6). Attention! Robert released a new
beta of RHIDE (1.4.9) containing one of the newest editors.
  Here are some of the reasons you could have:

1) You like the editor and want to use it without needing to start the whole
IDE. The editor have a half of the size of RHIDE mainly because GDB isn't
inside of the editor. I use my editor to edit all the files I create ;-).
2) You are a RHIDE fanatic and want to test the new features or check if
some bug was killed.
3) You are a djgpp fanatic and want to collect anything made with djgpp (I'm
one of these crazy mans ;-).
4) You don't like RHIDE at all, you think it sucks, but you think you can
help to make it a really good thing.

Ok, where can I get it?

 http://setedit.sourceforge.net/

(DOS/Linux/Win32 sources/binaries/cvs are available from this page
 QNX/FreeBSD/Solaris versions must be compiled from sources).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

New [41 things]:

+ Various [16]

* FreeBSD support.
* Solaris support.
* QNX support.
* Big endian CPUs support (runs quite well on SPARC machines).
* X11 (X Window) native support.
* Support for X11 clipboards and mouse wheel.
* Much better XTerm and Eterm support.
* New screen, fonts and encoding dialogs with more and better options.
* An option to select a "Color Theme", currently only the "Default", "FTE
like" and "Console + VIM" themes are available.
* Euro symbol to the fonts.
* More fonts are available.
* Now is possible to indicate a project to load without the extension in the
command line.
* Option to generate HTML 4.01 + CSS in the HTML export.
* Now if you unindent uncommenting the editor checks that at least the first
line is already indented, if not the operation is aborted.
* Now the matchpair and the complementary element jumps are affected
by the syntax highlight.
* An LRU algorithm to remove entries in the closed list.

+ Configuration [4]

* Configuration questions in the installer [DOS and Linux .deb files].
* Now ~/.tcedit.dst have more priority than ~/tcedit.dst.
* Option to save a desktop file in the current directory.
* Independent set of options are stored for each driver used (DOS, Linux,
X11, etc.) in the desktop files.

+ InfView/ManView [3]

* Ctrl+Arrows support.
* Support fot copy from man page to: editor's clipboard, main OS clipboard
and secondary OS clipboard.
* The default ManView colors as suggested by Ivan, now they are more coherent
with InfView.

+ List of functions [2]

* If two identical functions (most probably only one is really used at compile
time) both are listed in the list of functions.
* PHP functions parser. Ivan Baldo &lt;lubaldo@adinet.com.uy&gt;

+ Run external programs and message window [4]

* Options to avoid reseting the horizontal position of the message window
when new entries are added.
* Options to indicate when we reached the last/first item in the errors list.
* "Vertical project window" options.
* Tasm 2.02 errors parser.

+ Edition modes [1]

* When the user sets the "Use Tabs" option the editor checks if
other options commonly used with tabs are also coherent. If not an advice
dialog is created.

+ Sound system []

* Solaris support.

+ Syntax highlight and pmacros [6]

* Lua. David A. Capello &lt;dacap@users.sourceforge.net&gt;.
* Flat Assembler. Matt C. &lt;talktomatt@egl.net&gt;
* PHP. Richard Vrijhof &lt;R.J.Vrijhof@bigfoot.com&gt;.

* Turbo Vision configuration files.
* XML [Very limited!!]

+ Linux [2]

* A clipboard mechanism based on a special file.
* AA-lib plasma screen saver.

+ Cosmetic [2]

* The editor now checks if the screen saver is suitable for the current
driver.
* When the editor loads a file the "busy indicator" is used (different mouse
cursor under X11).


Fixed [26 things]:

+ Fatal  [5]

* SIGSEGVs when using "Tool&Ops|Options|Run program" when no desktop file was
loaded.
* Buffer overflow in temporary names created by infview (L_tmpnam).
* When starting the editor with a remmembered file that no longer
exists located in a directory where we don't want backups the editor
removed the dektop structure from the list and inmediatly used it.
* Crash in InfView when no desktop file was available.
* Some problems that made the editor crash when opening a file from
the windows list dialog and this process needed to show a messageBox.

+ Not fatal [13]

* A bug in InfView parser. When a node had a lot of cross references
that started in a line and ended in another *and* the last cross reference
was near to the end of the node *and* the hide options were enabled.
* Code generated for a recorded macro now uses \t instead of an ASCII 9
embedded in the string.
* The show match pair on the fly without waiting had an interaction with the
syntax highlight computation.
* C++ operators parsing in the list of functions.
* When browsing the list of errors and selecting an error reported
in a non-existant file the editor opened an empty buffer.
* When the editor fails to load a desktop file (wrong version,
corrupted file, wrong access rights, ect.) the editor tries to load the
global desktop file.
* One preprocessor combination that fooled the functions parser.
* When typing in overwrite mode the line length was wrongly computed.
* The editor didn't allow to save ReadOnly files using "Save As".
* The selection adjust done when we leave a line under edition failed if the
line had extra spaces at the end.
* Now when choosing to "never remember windows" the options "resume" isn't
applied.
* When indenting a block using the arbitrary indent or comment indent the
syntax highlight wasn't recomputed.
* C/C++ functions list parser to support namespaces.

+ Undo [1]

* Bug in the undo of text typed while using overwrite mode.

+ DOS [3]

* The installer now uses cwsdpmi and a regular stub (much more reliable than
pmodedj).
* Ctrl+Break is now blocked.
* When using the editor without djgpp the editor failed to find the
internationalization files.

+ Cosmetic [4]

* The ASCII window grown after a window resize.
* "Shell" instead of "DOS shell".
* Error in docs about delete left/right word.
* When restoring the settings of a closed window (or project item) the
"overwrite" status wasn't reflected in the cursor shape.
