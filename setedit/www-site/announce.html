<HTML><Title>announce for setedit</Title><Body><Pre>That's the announcement that I released the SET's editor Iguazu I release
(v0.5.2):

What's SET's editor?

  SETEdit or setedit or SET's editor is a text mode oriented text editor
with the look & feel of the old Borland's IDE. It have windows that can be
overlapped, common widgets (buttons, menues, check and radio buttons,
etc.), mouse support and old the funny things you usually find in a GUI
editor (even when all is in text mode).
  The editor is mainly oriented for programmers because it have tons of
tools that helps writing programs, specially C/C++, but suitable to edit
any kind of text file. In fact the code page and fonts handling options
make it very suitable to edit text in different encodings and convert it
back and forth from one encoding to another. Some nice widgets like
graphical screen savers and MP3 player also makes the editor a funny
environment.
  For those who know about RHIDE: setedit is the same editor you can find
inside RHIDE but without the IDE itself, as it's the last version have more
features (and bugs?, I hope it have less ;-), seriously, I killed a huge
number of bugs most small but some very annoying).
  Is also true that some features takes a lot of time to be incorporated to
RHIDE or just won't be incorporated to RHIDE at all. The standalone editor
is also very suitable to be used for the parts of your project that are
handled with makefiles.

Main features:
* Easy to use for DOS users because have a lot of CUA and Wordstar commands
used in the editors of other compilers.
* Full configurable keyboard.
* Full configurable menu (OS dependent features and macros in menues).
* Advanced features: Rectangular blocks, intelligent indent, configurable
syntax highlight and more.
* Simple macro language, will be expanded only if the people is interested
and helps a bit (which is starting to happend).
* PMacros for fast writing.
* Real macros.
* Documentation tool for libraries or large projects.
* Fonts, code pages, screen modes and palette customization.
* You can run make or grep from the editor collecting the errors/hints.
* Clock and screen saver.
* Linux and Win32 versions (FreeBSD, QNX and Solaris also supported).

Why I could want to download it if RHIDE exists?

  The editor is the newest version v0.5.2 and have a lot of differences with
the one included in RHIDE 1.4 (v0.3.6). Attention! Robert released a new
beta of RHIDE (1.4.9) containing one of the newest editors.
  Here are some of the reasons you could have:

1) You like the editor and want to use it without needing to start the whole
IDE. The editor have a half of the size of RHIDE mainly because GDB isn't
inside of the editor. I use my editor to edit all the files I create ;-).
2) You are a RHIDE fanatic and want to test the new features or check if
some bug was killed.
3) You are a djgpp fanatic and want to collect anything made with djgpp (I'm
one of these crazy mans ;-).
4) You don't like RHIDE at all, you think it sucks, but you think you can
help to make it a really good thing.

...

Ok, where can I get it?

 http://setedit.sourceforge.net/

(DOS/Linux/Win32 sources/binaries/cvs are available from this page
 QNX/FreeBSD/Solaris versions must be compiled from sources).

[40 new things and 25 fixes]

New [40 things]:

+ Various [19]

* Word completion. Based on tag files.
* Jump to symbol (not only functions: variables, structures, etc.). Based on
tag files.
* Class browser. Based on tag files.
* An option to control the size of newly opened files. When enabled the
windows tries to avoid overlapping the message and project windows. It was
suggested by Ivan Baldo.
* Every 8 seconds or when we focuse a text window the editor checks if the
copy on disk of the file we are editing changed. When the editor detects the
copy on disk is newer asks for reload. But ...
* If we also modified the copy in memory the editor asks for 4 options:
 1) Load the file from disk, it discards changes in the copy we have on
 memory.
 2) Don't do anything, the user must solve the problem.
 3) Like 1 but the editor invokes diff -u and shows the output.
 4) Like 2 but with diff like in 3.
* Support to porperly display international messages even when changing the
code page used by the editor. The messages are recoded on the fly.
* Color scheme contributed by Juan Diego (bach) Ianelli. Is called "Dark JDI".
* Options to export/import project items using a text file.
* Now you can load a project located outside the current directory.
* Holidays highlight to the calendar. Volunteers to support it for each
country are wanted.
* A dialog to dis/enable any advice dialog (also the Quit + delete warning).
* Made the "Paste Emacs mode" more robust. If the first line is
"#!..." the comment is pasted in the second. If the mode was already
pasted by the editor it is first deleted. Suggested by Grzegorz.
* Commands to allow configuring the editor to copy/paste the text in input
lines to/from the OS clipboard.
* Command called cmcJumpLastCursorPos. It works similar to cmcLastPosCur but
uses a different mechanism. I assigned this command to ^Q-P that according to
Alain is the WordStar command for it.
* Command that inserts a new line without moving the cursor nor indenting.
This is the old WordStar ^N command.
* Option to avoid redirecting stdout when running an external program. Useful
for interactive applications that uses stdout.
* cmcCommentIndent/cmcCommentUnIndent now indents the current line if nothing
is selected. Suggested by Thiago.
* Commands to copy from the message window to the OS clipboard. Suggested by
Thiago.

+ Compilation [4]

* The compilation process was simplified and BC++ now can be used to create
Win32 version of the editor with the same facility than gcc.
* Support for makeinfo 4.4 and newer (breaks the old API).
* More detailed documentation for each target.
* Scripts to generate RPMs.

+ sLisp [8]

* loop and exitloop sentences. From Bernd Becker.
* Find command. Contributed by Bernd.
* GetCursorX, GetCursorY and SetCursorXY commands.
* ==, !=, ++ and -- operators.
* (repeat times commands...) from code and ideas contributed by Bernd.
* (= var value) as an alias for (setv ...
* GetSyntaxLang command to find which syntax highlight is in use.
* Two constants to be used by RunProgram. They are for the old option (use
OS/user screen) and the new option to avoid redirecting stdout.

+ Syntax highlight and pmacros [5]

* More python keywords. Contributed by Grzegorz.
* Emacs modes and shell names for CSS, Tcl, Java and Python. Suggested by
Grzegorz.
* SQL emacs modes and keywords. Suggested by Grzegorz.
* Made more robust the "shell script" shl detection. It now supports:
"#!.../env command" and "#!.../commandVERSION" (i.e. python2.2). From
Grzegorz suggestions.
* Errors parser for ANT Java Builder. Contributed by Grzegorz.

+ Linux [1]

* Support for UTF-8 consoles (i.e. RedHat 8.0 and 9.0).

+ X11 [1]

* The powered grep now paints the screen more often and shows the busy
indicator.

+ Cosmetic [2]

* Calendar windows can be closed pressing ESC.
* ManView window can be closed with ESC. Suggested by Thiago.



Fixed [25 things]:

+ Fatal  [2]

* When a directory contained a project with a desktop file newer
than the current setedit version and a default desktop file from a version
older than 0.5.0 the editor rejected the new file but preloaded it doing
a mess at the time of loading the old file.
* When doing a search in/outside comments close to the first line you could
get a GPF. Reported by Bernd Becker.

+ Not fatal [12]

* Memory leak in about dialog.
* When jumping to a hit in the message window and the first column contained
a matching [{( and the editor was configure to do match pair on the fly: the
message quickly dissapear.
* When typing at the end of the visible area the editor not always scrolled 8
columns making it slow.
* Tips code tried to jump to editor.inf which is no longer called like it.
* Some problems when doing incremental searches in some list boxes.
* Indentation problems in some pmacros.
* "Intelligent indent" mode needed "Backspace unindents" enabled to work
properly.
* The list of "functions" supports things that aren't strcitly programming
languages, like texinfo sources, for this reason the "space" key should't act
as item selector (can be part of the name in an incremental search).
* When switching from a window with some syntax highlight to another
with a different shl and using Alt+F2 it was common to get a wrong result
because the editor used the old shl.
* The -m command line option was disabled.
* Find whole words and out/inside comments didn't work together. Reported by
Alain.
* Fails in the "Export as HTML" command when some text was selected.

+ Compilation [1]

* Issues with newer gcc 3.x (upto 3.3) versions and BC++ 5.6 (CBuilder 6).

+ sLisp [1]

* The RunProgram command was affected by the options in the configuration
dialog.

+ Linux [1]

* When running an external program and using the "OS screen" the editor made
a complete mess. Only in console.

+ X11 [1]

* Problems using the mouse in InfView windows.

+ Cosmetic [7]

* The main documentation was reviewed and a lot of errors fixed.
* Color names now are coherent, all start with a capital letter.
* Shortcut collision between Copy/paste to/from OS clipboard and file
clipboard options.
* After loading a file from a desktop file with column cursor enabled
it wasn't visible until the cursor was moved.
* When no project is available now the "Powered Grep" avoids using
"search in projects" as default.
* Now when you "Quit" and the warning dialog pops up you can press
Escape to abort the process. Suggested by Alex Lozano.
* + and - should change month in calendar.
