Hi! That's the readme file for the sources.

0. Urgent! I'm in a hurry ...

  This is a really simple explanation, I strongly suggest reading the
INSTALL.txt file.
  If you are running Linux or djgpp equiped with most UNIX tools (shell
utils, file utils, perl, make, etc.) you can try the following:
[Windows NT users skip it]

1) Install, configure, make and make install the Turbo Vision library (last
version available).
2) Do the same with the editor, here is how if you don't know:

A) Run the configure script (./configure or configure).

Examples:
   linux:/usr/src/tvision# ./configure
   c:\djgpp\contrib\tvision>configure

B) If all is OK run "make".
C) If all is OK just run "make install".

  With it you'll get the editor compiled and installed.
  If the configure script makes a wrong guess about something and you want to
run it again delete the configure.cache file to force a new fresh
configuration.
  If the installation prefix directory is wrongly guessed call the configure
script passing --prefix=dir as argument.
Example:
  linux:/usr/src/tvision# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

  If you are using Windows NT just read the WinNT\README file.
  Note: This mechanism works for MingW32 (Win95/8) but you need some GNU
tools installed that are not included in the MingW32 package.



1. Introduction:

  For information about copyrights read the copyrigh file, the editor is
mostly GPL/LGPL. I made it GPL because is the less restrictive license for
developing, not for people trying to use the editor's sources. Why? if the
code is GPL I can use GPL sources in my code without problems and I want to
use good code from others instead of reinventing things.
  Note: I put a lot of effort to make the compilation smooth but you should
read all the docs and get all the needed tools.



2. How to compile:

  The file INSTALL.txt contains some basic instructions and explains which
file you have to read according with your system.


Happy hacking.
