1 Features and motivation
*************************

First time I used the info viewer from GNU I really hated it. I don't doubt
that info is a powerful browser, but isn't so easy to use. The interface is
unclear and isn't intuitive at all.

My first solution was to create a converter to translate the info files to the
Norton Guides format. The program can be found in SimTelnet, but the problem
is that this format have some limitations and you need a browser for it.
Even when there are shareware browsers that's a problem.

So my next attempt was to make a browser like the one used by the Turbo Vision
library. And the result was InfView. InfView provides a very easy to use
interface without loosing power.

The main features of InfView are:

   * Free cursor movement with the keyboard arrows, page-up, etc.

   * Mouse support.

   * Highlighted cross references.

   * Hide of the `*Note' and other confusing things of the info format.

   * Previous, Next and Up node support.

   * History support.

   * Incremental search just typing the first letters of the cross reference.

   * The same for the whole nodes list.

   * Support for compressed info files. See compressed files ("Compressed
     files" Chapter 3).

   * Search in the current node, the whole file or all the files.

   * Bookmarks.

   * History of the last 40 nodes visited.

   * Dialog to browse the files on disk.

   * and more

2.1 Jumping to any file or node
===============================

Go To Window:

You must enter the exact name of the topic that you want in the following
format:

     (file)node

For example: `(libc)printf' will go to the printf help.

2.2 Jumping to any node in the current file
===========================================

This option will show you a window with all the nodes available in the
current help file. You'll be able to select any of them and pressing <ENTER>
you'll jump to that node.

The names are alphabetically sorted and pressing the first letters of the
name of the node you'll be guided to the desired node.

2.3 Control dialog

This dialog controls the navigation in InfView. The dialog contains the
following buttons:

   * Next
     - Action: Moves to the next node in the help

   * Previous
     - Action: Moves to the previous node in the help

   * Up
     - Action: Moves one node up in the help's hierarchy

   * Prev. Hist.
     - Action: Goes to the previously visited node

   * Nodes List
     - Action: Shows a list of all the nodes to choose one

Additionally the dialog contains a list with the last 40 nodes visited, you
can choose any of them with the mouse of the cursors.

2.4 Bookmarks dialog
====================

This dialog allows to save the names of the nodes that you use frequently. You
can save as many node positions as you want and they will be restored next
time you run the editor. The marks can be deleted from this window too.

2.5 Configuration dialog
========================

This dialog configures how InfView shows the text in screen.

Currently there are two settings:

  1. Hide '*Note' word: It hides the note tag used make makeinfo to indicate a
     cross reference.

  2. Hide real link name: It makes visible only the comment about the node
     and no the real name of the node.

By default both are enabled and gives a cleaner text.

2.6 Searching
=============

InfView have various search options, these options are grouped in two
sections. The first indicates how the search will be make:

   * Case sensitive: Makes the search sensitive to the upper/lower case
     characters.

   * Whole words only: Force to match only if the whole word matchs.

The second indicates where to search:

   * In current topic: Only in the text of the current node.

   * In the file: In all the nodes of the current help file.

   * In all files: In all the files located in the INFO directory.

3 Compressed files
******************

InfView supports compressed info files. For that they must have one of the
following extentions `igz', `gz', `info.gz' or `inz'.  Additionally they must
be compressed with GNU's gzip and gzip must be installed in your system and
in your search path.

Compressing the files under Linux or Windows 95 (with LFN=Y) is relative easy
because you only need to compress the files and they will have the `gz'
extention added. Under plain DOS is a little  harder because a file called
`file.i10' will become `file.i1z' and will have the same name as a compressed
file that had the following name `file.i1'. To fix that you must first rename
the files to have the following format: `file.nn'.  Then you must edit the
first file to fix the `Indirect' table to reflect the changes.
