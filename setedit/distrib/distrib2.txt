That's the announcement that I released the SET's editor v@@v@@:

What's SET's editor?

  Is the same editor you can find inside RHIDE but without the IDE itself,
as it's the last version have more features (and bugs?, I hope it have
less ;-), seriously, I killed a huge number of bugs most small but some very
annoying).
  For the people that doesn't know about RHIDE:
  Is an editor specially designed for C/C++ programmers, but suitable to edit
any kind of text file.

Main features:
* Easy to use for DOS users because have a lot of CUA and Wordstar commands
used in the editors of other compilers.
* Full configurable keyboard.
* Full configurable menu (OS dependent features and macros in menues (new)).
* Advanced features: Rectangular blocks, intelligent indent, configurable
syntax highlight and more.
* Simple macro language, will be expanded only if the people is interested
and helps a bit (which starting to happend).
* PMacros for fast writing.
* Real macros.
* Documentation tool for libraries or large projects.
* Fonts, code pages, screen modes and palette customization.
* You can run make or grep from the editor collecting the errors/hints.
* Clock and screen saver.
* Linux version.

Why I could want to download it if RHIDE exists?

  The editor is the newest version v@@v@@ and have a lot of differences with
the one included in RHIDE 1.4 (v0.3.6). Attention! Robert released a new
beta of RHIDE (1.4.7) containing the editor v0.4.17. And Andris released
another beta (1.4.7.4) using v0.4.39.
  Here are some of the reasons you could have:

1) You like the editor and want to use it without needing to start the whole
IDE. The editor have a half of the size of RHIDE mainly because GDB isn't
inside of the editor. I use my editor to edit all the files I create ;-).
2) You are a RHIDE fanatic and want to test the new features or check if
some bug was killed. I specially recommend it for people that have problems
with the bugs in "Optimal fill" and for the ones who wants to see macros or
word wrap in RHIDE.
3) You are a djgpp fanatic and want to collect anything made with djgpp (I'm
one of these crazy mans ;-).
4) You don't like RHIDE at all, you think it sucks, but you think you can
help to make it a really good thing.

Note: Actually Robert is working to incorporate it to RHIDE. But so slowly
...

Ok, where can I get it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

New [23 things]:

* Configurable mechanism to parse the errors collected from an external
application. It uses Perl RegEx to do the job. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Now you can pass extra command line options using an environment variable
called SET_CMDLINE.
* Menu option to save the project manually. Suggested by Jeremy W.
Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>
* Project window also says the name of the project file. Suggested by Jeremy
W. Murphy <jwm@amc.com.au>.
* Command line option +[line number], like in VI. Suggested by Ivan.
* When calling the man page viewer the editor offers the word under cursor
as man page.
* Shl flag "EscapeAnywhere" this switch makes the editor parse the escape
character outside strings.
* Syntax highlight for PLM/51 contributed by Jari Korhonen
<jari.korhonen@ponsse.fi>. (Intel's long-gone not-so-highlevel language for
8051 CPUs).
* Command line switch to specify files to load from an external list of files
where each line is a file. Suggested by SpaZe.
* Three command line switches: --tile-vert, --tile-horiz and --cascade
to make these operations after loading the files from the desktop file or
named in the command line. Suggested by Spaze.
* The reverse operation for "HTML accents". Suggested by Gregorio.
* Now the file open dialog is resizeble. Suggested by Gregorio.
* Yet another tab mode. "Tab indents", it is by default enabled because
that's what the editor ever did. Disabling it the editor will behave like
when using tabs but will insert spaces instead of tabs.

+ Linux

* Debian package for InfView.
* ISO-8859-1 spanish messages.
* InfView man page. Pointed out by Ivan,
* Now the convert HTML accents feature also works in Linux, was just matter
of enabling it.
* Now the editor disables the Xon/Xoff mode of the terminal so ^Q/^S aren't
used for it. It enables the use of ^Q and ^S when running in an Xterm, Eterm,
etc.

+ DOS

* Now the editor also looks for HOME and HOMEDIR when loading configuration
files. Also: the directory where the exe is located is the one looked at last.

+ Cosmetic:

* Now the message window shows ^M if the line contains /r.
* Changed the way the INFOPATH is guessed under DOS. A djgpp user installed
the editor outside the djgpp tree and then the editor used INFOPATH but
failed to find the setedit.inf file. Now the editor also adds your tree even
if INFOPATH is defined. Reported by Sylvia <smlew@ifocus.com.sg>.
* Now if you use "load only specified files" the editor doesn't really load
the files to then close'm like before. It makes things faster.
* Now the new option to search the word when you press ^F1 inside
the node takes the visible name you choose from the list and not the word
under cursor. Suggested by Gregorio.


Fixed [10 things]:

* Problems with info files created with the new Texinfo 4.0 package.
* Abort when pressing ENTER in the message window without items.
* Bug in sLisp when handling strings with escape sequences (\n, \t, etc.).
Reported by Uwe Steinmann <steinm@majestix.fernuni-hagen.de>.
* GPF/SIGSEGV when using BackSpace in the functions list to delete the first
letter in the incremental search. Reported by Gregorio.
* Crashes when starting the editor and it was playing an MP3 file that doesn't
exist anymore.

+ Linux:

* Problems when saving files in DOS format. Reported by Gregorio.
* When switching from hidden to normal desktop files the editor left the
hidden version of the desktop file generating potential confusions. Now the
hidden file is removed.

+ DOS:

* Problems with project files. Reported by Ryan Owen <ryan@eyring.com>.

+ Cosmetic:

* The ~K~eep short-cut in the SDG options was used for O~K~. Reported
by Gregorio.
* When inserting items to the project the editor used the *.epr mask instead
of the one used to open regular files. Reported by Gregorio.

There are more small changes just take a look to change.log.
